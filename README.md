Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Tetra-PEG
========
A new class of high-strength hydrogels has been developed and fabricated using two same-sized, symmetrical tetrahedron-like macromonomers[1,2]. The resultant polymer was found to have high mechanical strength comparable to a human articular cartilage. Hence this biocompatible tetra-PEG gel is expected to be applicable as a biomedical material. This research is meant to explore the mechanical properties of a homogeneous tetra-PEO hydrogel with idealized diamond connectivity through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and to elucidate the relationship between the structure and the mechanical properties, and the deformation of mechanism of the tough hydrogels.
